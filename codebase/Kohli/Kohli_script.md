###  Goals for the video

We want to explore why Kohli is not scoring runs. This video will then go into details and try to find the possible solution. The aim of the video will be to explore with the watcher, the potential reasons behind Kohli's lack of form in test matches. We want to go through the following reason as to why Kohli's game has been affected.

#### Good Form
First we should open the video with Kohli's good form. For this we will present Kohli's good form period that we calculated and show that it was an unprecedented good period for Kohli. To prove this we can show that Kohli is above other batsman for an extended period.

## Introduction

Cricket is a game of many unknowns. On each ball, we as fans stay on the edges of our seats wondering what is to come. Every has the potential to be a match defining event. We can see the batsman impose himself, crunching the bowler authoritatively to the boundary rope, or the bowler hit back, with a ripping delivery, sending the batsman's stumps, and confidence, spiralling away.

For a batsman, this nature of the game is even harsher. On any day, the same delivery that takes the edge, can either nestle into the safe hands of a waiting slip, or just as easily race past gully for a welcome boundary to get their innings underway. This is why many say cricket is a very harsh game, a true representation of the challenges and hardships one might expect to see in their own lifes. But like in life, in cricket, there come along players that seem to defy this uncertainty, players that seem to be playing in their own bubble, as if the game is to them just a hobby, and no one exemplified this more than Virat Kohli, especially between the years of 2015-2019

In this period Kohli was one of the most dominating and consistent(thesaurus) batsman in world cricket. Though his true dominance was in limited overs cricket, where arguably you would trust Kohli with your life to chase nearly any total, in test cricket, Kohli had a historically good run of form. In terms of runs, Kohli is in the top 15 for most runs in a 80 innings stretch. Furthermore, he dominated with these runs, he consistently scored hundreds away from home, which especially for a subcontinent player, is a true measure of their greatness, and was feared by nearly every opposing team that played India in this period. The aura of Kohli was further strengthened by the fact that Kohli's runs contributed to Indian wins. His aggressive batting mirrored his captaincy and subsequently team India has a whole, taking them from a pushover team, to one that was feared worldwide (not to mention that it allowed India's fast bowlers to thrive). In this historically outstanding period of batting, Kohli's scoring output fuelled India to strongholding every series at home, and push for test and series wins consistently away from home, something that India hadnt done before that point. If we consider the percetage of test wins during his period of scoring, we can see that Kohli is in elite company. 6th on the list only headed by the creme de la creme of test batting. Kohli was all but secured to be a batting great.
