###  Goals for the video

We want to explore why Kohli is not scoring runs. This video will then go into details and try to find the possible solution. The aim of the video will be to explore with the watcher, the potential reasons behind Kohli's lack of form in test matches. We want to go through the following reason as to why Kohli's game has been affected.

#### Good Form
First we should open the video with Kohli's good form. For this we will present Kohli's good form period that we calculated and show that it was an unprecedented good period for Kohli. To prove this we can show that Kohli is above other batsman for an extended period. 

**Graphs**
Graph that shows extended consistency and possibly adjusted average over 80 innings. The X-axis will be Average, the y axis is still a mystery because we have no other advance stats to measure batsman. The Y axis I have put as win probability, because I want to show that Kohli has scored runs and contributed to wins. Obviously this is not a direct indication, but if the batsman is scoreing runs, and the team is winning, there surely must be some sort of correlation.

Graph to show best batsman averages after 80 innings. Kohli is 6th/8th on this list.
    -So we have a graph that shows that Kohli is has the 6th highest total runs in a 80 match period. 
    -Can we make Kohli top if we consider team win percentage in this time? This would show that Kohli influenced team wins

Graph to show cover drive scoring rate over career and over an inning.
    - I think we made this graph, but basically we want to see if the scoring rate off the cover drive changes based on when Kohli is in strike and not in strike, etc. In general we had seen that this is not the case. Kohli's strike rate and frequency of playing the cover drive does not change based the number of runs he scored in an innings. So basically we can kind of conclude that Kohli does not really adapt his game based on how he is playing. He backs himself to play the cover drive no matter what and hit it. But actually this mentality is not good. Maybe overall strikerate is something that dips for Kohli? If thats the case then maybe we can see if it is the rate of him scoring off of other shots dipping that causes Kohli to play a cover drive at the wrong deliveries and fail as a result.

Career strike rates for each inning. So for each inning we can calculate the cumulative strike rate and then graph all of these, see if there is a dip at the start of Kohli's innings in and out of form.
    - Ok, so we calculated this and we can conclude that Kohli actually has a lower strike rate overall from his innings recenttly when he has been out of form. Though his cover drive play frequency remains the same. We can therefore conclude that Kohli is not hitting them as well, or he is missing out on getting runs from other shots. This culminates in him possibly playing a rash shot to get out. So the main things to check as a result of this "finding" are:
        - Is Kohli scoring less off of his cover drives
        - Is Kohli getting out more frequently to cover drives
        - What shot is Kohli struggling wrt strikerate
        - Do other batsman also have a dip in scoring rate in this period

Graphs to show average of indian batsman over career

Graph to show number of matches played by Kohli compared to other players

Need to develop a way to measure shot effectiveness, dot balls over runs scored, or attempts, or something like that

## Introduction

Cricket is a game of many unknowns. On each ball, we as fans stay on the edges of our seats wondering what is to come. Every has the potential to be a match defining event. We can see the batsman impose himself, crunching the bowler authoritatively to the boundary rope, or the bowler hit back, with a ripping delivery, sending the batsman's stumps, and confidence, spiralling away.

For a batsman, this nature of the game is even harsher. On any day, the same delivery that takes the edge, can either nestle into the safe hands of a waiting slip, or just as easily race past gully for a welcome boundary to get their innings underway. This is why many say cricket is a very harsh game, a true representation of the challenges and hardships one might expect to see in their own lifes. But like in life, in cricket, there come along players that seem to defy this uncertainty, players that seem to be playing in their own bubble, as if the game is to them just a hobby, and no one exemplified this more than Virat Kohli, especially between the years of 2015-2019

In this period Kohli was one of the most dominating and consistent(thesaurus) batsman in world cricket. Though his true dominance was in limited overs cricket, where arguably you would trust Kohli with your life to chase nearly any total, in test cricket, Kohli had a historically good run of form. In terms of runs, Kohli is in the top 15 for most runs in a 80 innings stretch. Furthermore, he dominated with these runs, he consistently scored hundreds away from home, which especially for a subcontinent player, is a true measure of their greatness, and was feared by nearly every opposing team that played India in this period. The aura of Kohli was further strengthened by the fact that Kohli's runs contributed to Indian wins. His aggressive batting mirrored his captaincy and subsequently team India has a whole, taking them from a pushover team, to one that was feared worldwide (not to mention that it allowed India's fast bowlers to thrive). In this historically outstanding period of batting, Kohli's scoring output fuelled India to strongholding every series at home, and push for test and series wins consistently away from home, something that India hadnt done before that point. If we consider the percetage of test wins during his period of scoring, we can see that Kohli is in elite company. 6th on the list only headed by the creme de la creme of test batting. Kohli was all but secured to be a batting great.
## Coverdrive
1. Kohli cover drive causing issues, data wise we can see the the frequency of shots played is the same, but we then need to analyse if the technique was off, which it was, he started going back to his 'old' way of playing the cover drive, which was causing him to edge the ball, furthermore, Kohli plays very far from his body always. This is another reason that he edges so many cover drives. The cover drive is NOT causing issues, we can see using cover drive runs scored, percentage of shots played with cover drives, etc, that Kohli is not really playing cover drives more or less and is actually having a hard time or scoring runs in general because he scoring slower and playing more dot balls. Therefore he is getting bogged down and as a result may be playing more rash shots/just not scoring as much. He still is facing a lot of balls, but just not getting any flow to his innings, which is resulting in him not really going on and making any big scores from the starts that he is getting. 

2. Kohli volume of cricket finally caught up with him, and this resulted in him not getting a break at all, we can use anecdotes from other cricketers about burnout in the game, as well as the fact that once Kohli took an extended time off before the Asia Cup and did not train, then he started to play better once more.

3. Kohli is having an end of career slump in test matches, this is indicitive of his age, and though it does not happen to other 'great' batsman, it seems that Indian batsman, especially captains, seems to have this issue, we can see that Ganguly, Tendulkar, VVS, they all had slumps towards the backend of their careers that they never recovered from, find the average age of these slumps and then we can try to evaluate if the same thing is happening with Kohli. We can then also reference some articles from Cricinfo that explored form vs class, and analysed if Kohli's form was in fact permanent or just temporary.
