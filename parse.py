'Appeal for lbw but not given! will bangladesh review? the keeper says in bengali, "not sure about impact", but mominul reviews anyway. big moment. replays show that this length ball pitched outside off 
but angled in sharply. hits his back leg as he misses the defense... and the ball is crashing into leg stump! three reds and kohli out for a duck.',

'What a dream debut so far!  the debutant gets the edge, and cap no 100 at first slip makes no mistake. fullish, outside off, inviting kohli for the drive. he looks to hit straight past the bowler, but the ball takes the outside edge instead. taylor tumbles backwards to take the catch, but ensures it stays safely within his hands',

"And he has got kohli first up but kohli reviews with one second to go. this is desperate reviewing, and he will be hoping there is an umpire's call on it because there is no way this is not out. this is just too good from southee. pitches it up for the outswinger, the ball seams back in after pitching, beats the inside edge on the drive, and he is hit plumb in front. wastes the review. will hate it for rahane or pujara to get a stinker from the umpire now. back to the delivery: this is the classic plan to kohli. keep bowling outside off for swing, and if it seams, you expose the other edge too. tood good on the day. a less attacking batsman would have probably got an inside edge on it, but that was one good nut. swing and seam both",

'Oh de grandgomme, what a beauty. he has teased, teased and trapped kohli in front. this is excellent seam bowling, and i stand corrected for underestimating him. sir colin, as bazid khan likes to call him. on a length, just outside off, shaping up to swing, but it seams upon pitching and goes past the inside edge to trap kohli in front. no drs review wastage this time',

"Now cummins has the kohli wicket. i think all the wickets at the other end have unsettled kohli, and made him decide he has to take on the bowling. fullish in a wide-ish channel outside off, and kohli does something he didn't do at all in the first innings, attempt a cover drive against such a ball. slices it to gully, where green seems to have taken a clean catch low to his left, but they're checking 
anyway. soft signal is out. he caught it a few inches above the turf, but the issue is whether it slipped momentarily from his grasp on his way down. there seems to be a bit of a juggle, but it's hard to tell, given he's landing in an area of shadow, so it stays with the soft signal",

"Some drift, turn and sharp bounce for bess. sharper catch at short leg from pope. tossed up outside off, dips, creating distance between the bat and the pitch of the ball. kohli has a hard-handed waft at it, the ball turns to graze the inside edge and pops to pope who lunges to his right. textbook-style offspinner's dismissal. huge breakthrough for england",

"Wow, moeen has knocked over kohli for a duck. the india captain hangs around. he can't believe what has just happened! moeen tosses it up, finds drift outside off, then it rips back in so very sharply to hit the top of off. this offbreak dips sharply as well, creating distance between the bat and the pitch of the ball, making kohli's attempt to drive through the covers look a whole lot worse. moeen just burst through the gate and silenced chepauk",

"Banged in short, and there's the breakthrough! wow, that's a vast moment in this match ... kohli is drawn into a loose defensive waft as the ball gets big on him outside off, and foakes snaffles the skipper for a duck! india have trudged along at barely a run an over, and it's given england the chance to pile on the pressure now",

"And kohli is gone in the dying moments of the day. not to anderson but to robinson. hard hands, defensive shot to a wide ball, and the edge is taken for root to take it at first slip. this is a shot that won't get him any runs. perhaps he could watch rahul and rohit: either drive or leave. so even if you get the edge, you give yourself a chance to clear the fielders",

ball coming back and it just keeps going on the angle, grazing the outside edge! england are running around like headless chickens, and this test may have just been blown wide open...',

"But he's bowling like hadlee here. third wicket for him, and it's that man kohli. the benefits, once again, of bowling appreciably fuller at headingley. full in the corridor, moving away just a touch, and kohli won't be pleased with the shot he's attempted. looks to drive through mid-off, playing well in front of his body, and only manages to edge it to buttler, who's already had a busy day behind the 
stumps. this straightened off the seam. wasn't the outswinger. it seemed to come down with a scrambled seam",

"Taken at first slip! it's three for ngidi. i said earlier that kohli fancies himself if he's chasing wide outside off for his favoured cover drive. he fancied his chances with this one too, but ngidi has managed to get late swing away. it's a good length ball, very very wide outside off and swinging away too. kohli makes a big shuffle across and swishes at that, and it's a pretty easy catch at first slip. thin line between glorious and shocking when kohli attempts that shot. ngidi has made the best of it",

aimed a booming drive at it, got a thick edge that flew at rapid pace. markram makes a difficult catch look easy, timing his jump perfectly to pluck it with arm stretched out fully above his head. the ball swung a touch as it was reaching kohli, which is why he perhaps got the edge instead of middling it.",
